# C++ Labs
This repository contains some of my C++ labs from [EE208](https://maynoothuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/ann_dempsey_mu_ie/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?guestaccesstoken=Rk%2fRpqvCJ%2fqEIlLJMLwxRTfz9Cfc6pDhwAJeBbd5oRI%3d&docid=07459b3e7dce042b581fb4be04b392ab3&action=default&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9tYXlub290aHVuaXZlcnNpdHktbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vOnc6L2cvcGVyc29uYWwvYW5uX2RlbXBzZXlfbXVfaWUvRWVleldYVGczTFZDZ2Z0TDRFczVLck1Cd1JuQjdNdlpSb1d1LUZHRFNRWkVodz9ydGltZT13SHFvUVBKRjEwZw) (Object Oriented Programming) in second semester of my second year in college. All the exercises were completed by me and sometimes with the help of the demonstrators in the labs. I also used [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to help me with some exercises.

Below is a list of all labs and exercises along with a short description:

# Lab 1
  - [exercise_1_1](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_1.cpp): A program that accepts the input of three integers from the keyboard, and  prints the sum, average, product, smallest, and largest of these numbers.
  
  - [exercise_1_2](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_2.cpp): A program that reads in two integers and determines and prints whether the first is a multiple of the second.
  
  - [exercise_1_3](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_3.cpp): A program that accepts input of a five-digit number, separates the number into its individual digits and prints the digits  separated from one another by three spaces each.
  
  - [exercise_1_4](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_4.cpp): A program that will determine whether a bank customer has exceeded the overdraft limit on their bank account when they try to make a withdrawal.
  
  - [exercise_1_5](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_5.cpp): A program that determines whether a number is prime and prints out all the prime numbers between 1 and 5000.
  
  # Lab 2
  
  - [exercise_2_1](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%202/exercise_2_1.cpp): A program that simulates the rolling of two dice and prints out the percentage of times each pair of values occurs, in a tabulated format.
  
  - [exercise_2_2](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%202/exercise_2_2.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of the swap function and prints out the values stored in the variables.
  
  - [exercise_2_3](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%202/exercise_2_3.cpp): Extension to [exercise_2_2](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%202/exercise_2_2.cpp) that overloads the swap function with two more  swap functions, which swap two float variables and two characters, respectively.
  
  - [exercise_2_4](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%202/exercise_2_4.cpp): Extension to [exercise_2_3](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%202/exercise_2_3.cpp) that includes a default parameter in each of the three functions and prints to the screen giving details of which of the three swap functions was called.
  
  - [exercise_2_5](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%202/exercise_2_5.cpp):A program that allows the user to input a sequence of 5 doubles and then prints that sequence in reverse.
  
  - [exercise_2_6](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%202/exercise_2_6.cpp): A program that prints out the first N integers in the Fibnacci sequence in reverse, where N is entered by the user at run-time.
  
  # Lab 3
  
  - [exercise_3_1](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%203/exercise_3_1.cpp): A program that creates an array of integers of size 10 and outputs the largest element and its index in that array.
