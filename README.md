# C-plus-plus-labs
This repository contains some of my C++ labs from EE208 (Object Oriented Programming) in second semester of my second year in college. All the exercises were completed by me and sometimes with the help of the demonstrators in the labs. I also used stackoverflow.com to help me with some exercises.

Below is the list of all labs and exercises along with a short description:

# Lab 1
  - exercise_1_1: A program that accepts the input of threeintegers from the keyboard, and  prints the sum, average, product, smallest, and largest of these numbers.
  
  - exercise_1_2: A program that reads in two integers and determines and prints whether the first is a multiple of the second.
  
  - exercise_1_3: A program that accepts input of a five-digit number, separates the number into its individual digits and prints the digits  separated from one another by three spaces each.
