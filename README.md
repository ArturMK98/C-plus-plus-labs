# C-plus-plus-labs
This repository contains some of my C++ labs from EE208 (Object Oriented Programming) in second semester of my second year in college. All the exercises were completed by me and sometimes with the help of the demonstrators in the labs. I also used [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) to help me with some exercises.

Below is the list of all labs and exercises along with a short description:

# Lab 1
  - [exercise_1_1](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_1.cpp): A program that accepts the input of threeintegers from the keyboard, and  prints the sum, average, product, smallest, and largest of these numbers.
  
  - [exercise_1_2](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_2.cpp): A program that reads in two integers and determines and prints whether the first is a multiple of the second.
  
  - [exercise_1_3](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_3.cpp): A program that accepts input of a five-digit number, separates the number into its individual digits and prints the digits  separated from one another by three spaces each.
  
  - [exercise_1_4](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_4.cpp): A program that will determine whether a bank customer has exceeded the overdraft limit on their bank account when they try to make a withdrawal.
  
  - [exercise_1_5](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%201/exercise_1_5.cpp): A program that determines whether a number is prime and prints out all the prime numbers between 1 and 5000.
  
  # Lab 2
  
  - [exercise_2_1](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-plus-plus-labs/blob/master/EE208%20Lab%202/exercise_2_1.cpp): A program that simulates the rolling of two dice and prints out the percentage of times each pair of values occurs, in a tabulated format.
